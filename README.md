# CS107_Stanford

Here would be some lecture notes and assignments coming. I would try my best to take the note seriously with detail. If that is combined with some chinese characters, don't be bothered. If you also would like to attend this lecture, I hope my note could be helpful.

这里是我给CS107留下的电子版笔记， 我会努力做的比较可读并且保留足够的内容性。如果你也上这门课，希望我能帮到你。
